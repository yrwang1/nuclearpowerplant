# The Chernobyl Accident in 1986

The data used in this project were obtained from reports published in 1988 and 2017 by United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR). Those reports provide information about the effects of exposures from the Chernobyl Accident starting from 1986. The data are organized in form of tables at the end of each report, including the estimates of the release of radionuclides, their concentrations in the worldwide ground-level air, food, and human body, and some other interesting aspects such as population change. Here is the link of the UNSCEAR official website and all the reports published: https://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/chernobyl.html
