Those reports provide information about the effects of exposures from the Chernobyl Accident starting from 1986. The data are organized in form of tables at the end of each report, including the estimates of the release of radionuclides, their concentrations in the worldwide ground-level air, food, and human body, and some other interesting aspects such as population change. Here is the link of the UNSCEAR official website and all the reports published: https://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/chernobyl.html 2.2 The Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident in 2011 Data used for Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident were obtained from UNSCEAR 2020/2021 Report and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). The datasets from UNSCEAR report contains the evaluation of doses for public due to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. These data are provided for each age group (adults, 10-year-old children and one-year-old infants) for each geographical area group (all non-evacuated districts within Fukushima Prefecture, districts close to Fukushima prefectures (Chiba, Gunma, Ibaraki, Iwate, Miyagi and Tochigi, labeled as Neighbouring), and for all remaining prefectures in Japan (labeled as Remainder)). And four principal pathways by which members of the public can be exposed for the radioactive material released to the atmosphere are considered and summed up. The MAFF released the latest results of the detection of radioactive substances (mainly radioactive cesium) in agricultural, livestock and aquatic products after the accident. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The Chernobyl Accident in 1986 The original data published by UNSCEAR are organized in the form of tables. Therefore, we used the online PDF to Excel converter to transform those tables to .xlxs files. In this way, by using readxl::read_excel and setting skip to some value, we were able to drop messy headlines and get nice and neat data frames. The reports claim that external irradiation from radioactive materials dumped on the ground and consumption of contaminated food are the two key paths to consider in the dose assessment. For radionuclides, we only consider Iodine-131, Caesium-134, and Caesium-137 since they are the most significant contributions to total exposure and have been extensively considered by many countries. For contaminated food, only the most fundamental foods have been considered: milk, grains, leafy greens, other vegetables and fruits, and meat. Most people’s food intake can be classified into one of these five groups. Other foods, such as mushrooms and lake fish, have been found to absorb radionuclides and may be essential to some consumers, but they have little impact on collective dosage estimates. Therefore, we only focus on these variables in this project. During the process of data cleaning, the most frequently used package is tidyverse, which helps manipulate the data frames. The functions select, pivot_longer, and fill were applied to almost every data frame in order to select the variables we want and transform the data into a form for ggplot. The Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident in 2011 For data files related to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, the original data were downloaded as .xls files from the official website in the data section. The Excels turned out to be messy after reading in R using readxl::read_excel, so we did some work to process and clean them. For the fish-related files, 10 files covering from 2012 to 2021 were combined with rbind() and processed with multiple functions, and the number of samples below/exceeding the standard limit were counted using summarize() by year, type of fish species and prefecture. The agricultural products and milk-related files were pretty tidy so that pipes %&gt;% were used to simply extract and calculate the features. Data cleaning for the absorbed dose to the thyroid-related files were similar to the fish-related files. Messy headlines were first removed and only useful data were kept. Then, 9 Tables were combined and processed differently with multiple functions based on the age group and area. For details of coding, please see here.

As we can see from the plot, the concentration of I-131 is higher for all the countries than Cs-134 and Cs-137, whereas the concentration of Cs-134 is almost the lowest for all the countries. In addition, these countries were grouped by “North Europe”, “Central Europe”, “West Europe”, “South Europe”, “West Asia”, “East Asia”, and “North America” and the order is determined by the median value of the concentration of these three radionuclides. It is clear that Central Europe suffers the most and North America suffers the least. This intuitively makes sense if we take their distances to Chernobyl into account. Note these three x-axis have different scales. We designed the plot in this way since the concentration of I-131 is tremendously higher than the other two. If they used same scale, the points related to Cs-134 and Cs-137 would be very close to 0 and they would coincident. 6.1.2 Deposition This plot is about the deposition of Iodine-131 (I-131), Caesium-134 (Cs-134), and Caesium-137 (Cs-137) for the same countries in the previous plot. The deposition of radioactive materials is mainly related to rainfall. Again, the deposition of I-131 is higher for all the countries than Cs-134 and Cs-137, whereas the concentration of Cs-134 is almost the lowest for all the countries. In addition, these countries were grouped in the same way as the previous plot and the order is determined by the median as well. However, the order changes for other groups except Central Europe, East Asia, and North America. This might be due to the irregularity of weather. As mentioned before, the deposition pattern is related to rainfall. However, the distances to Chernobyl can still explain the unchanged order of Central Europe, East Asia, and North America. Note these three x-axis have different scales. We designed the plot in this way since the deposition of I-131 is tremendously higher than the other two. If they used same scale, the points related to Cs-134 and Cs-137 would be very close to 0 and they would coincident. 6.1.3 Radionuclide Releases to, Dispersion and Deposition in I-131 Cs137 6.1.4 Assessment of Doses to the Public 6.2 The Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident in 2011 6.2.1 Radionuclide Releases to, Dispersion and Deposition in Food 6.2.1.1 Seafood Marine Fish Species The results of the analysis of radioactive cesium (134Cs and 137Cs) in marine fish species showed that immediately after the nuclear power station accident in 2011, about 16% of samples collected in Fukushima prefecture exceeded the current standard limit (100 Bq/kg). Since then, the percentages of samples exceeding the standard limit tends to decrease over time, dropping to 0 starting in 2015. In Fukushima Prefecture, there have been no such cases for 6 consecutive years until 1 sample exceeding the standard limit was detected in 2021. In prefectures other than Fukushima, after 4 years without such cases, one sample was detected exceeding the standard limit in 2019, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Freshwater Fish Species The results of the analysis of radioactive cesium in freshwater fish species showed that many freshwater fish in Fukushima and other prefectures exceeded the current standard limit (100 Bq/kg) shortly after the nuclear power plant accident in 2011. Since then, the percentages of samples exceeding the standard limit has decreased year by year, with the exception of Fukushima prefecture in 2017 and 2021 and prefectures other than Fukushima in 2019. Comparing marine and freshwater fish species, we found that freshwater fish were more likely to be detected in excess of radiocaesium. Apparently, the corresponding trend for prefectures other than Fukushima Prefecture showed its percentages of samples with radiocaesium concentrations exceeding 100 Bq/kg were lower than in Fukushima Prefecture, and thus, fish in Fukushima prefecture were more contaminated with radioactive cesium in the four years following the accident than in other prefectures. And the radiocaesium concentration decreases over time for fish species. 6.2.1.2 Agricultural Products Rice, vegetables and fruits are the necessities of everyone’s daily life, providing some essential nutrients for our body and maintaining our health. So how do they perform in terms of radiocaesium concentrations? In order to see the change over time, we made a time series plot as shown below. From the plot we can see that the radioactive cesium content of these essential agricultural products is basically within the safe range. About 0.06% of fruit samples exceeded the current standard limit in 2017, while other samples contained less than 100 Bq/kg of radioactive cesium. Therefore, the accident has little impact on these agricultural products as a whole. 6.2.1.3 Raw Milk Milk is essential for people especially for infants, it not only contains high-quality protein, but also trace elements, especially calcium, that our body needs for growth. The standard limit of radioactive cesium content of milk is half of that of general food, which is 50 Bq/kg. Years here, such as 2010, are from April 2020 to March 2021, and so on. We see that about 4.62% of raw milk samples in 2010 exceeded the current standard limit, all those samples that exceeded were collected in March 2021 (but belongs to Year 2020 as defined), immediately after the accident, while all other samples contained less than 50 Bq/kg of radioactive cesium in the following years. Therefore, there is little impact on raw milk after the first year of the accident. 6.2.2 Assessment of Doses to the Public The two most important radionuclides are iodine and cesium, with varying dose levels. Iodine-131 is first absorbed by the thyroid after ingestion or inhalation, but it dissipates quickly because of its short half-life (8 days). The two isotopes of cesium (cesium-134 and cesium-137) have relatively long half-lives (2 and 30 years, respectively), and the exposure to the human body is fairly uniform. The Committee’s estimates of municipality- and prefecture-average doses are intended to be characteristic of the average doses to the thyroid absorbed by people living in each municipality or prefecture for the first year after the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power station accident. Due to the fact that the amount of data is too large to run in R, a dot plot is performed instead of a histogram or ridgeline plot. The plot clearly showed the trend that younger people tend to absorb higher dose to the thyroid than older people. It’s also obvious that the closer to Fukushima prefecture, where the accident occurred, the higher dose absorbed to the thyroid. Now let’s take a closer look at Fukushima prefecture. The ridgeline plot allow us to easily compare distributions of the absorbed doses. We see that the distributions for all age groups are multimodal that have many peaks. The younger the higher doses were absorbed, and the absorb range is wider.
