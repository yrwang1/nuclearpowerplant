On 26 April 1986, an accident occurred at the fourth unit of the Chernobyl nuclear power station. It was the most serious accident ever in the history of the nuclear power industry. The accident took many lives, caused serious social and psychological damage to the lives of the affected people, and brought huge economic losses to the entire region. On March 11, 2011, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPS) suffered significant damage from the magnitude 9.0 earthquake in eastern Japan and the subsequent tsunami. It was the largest civilian nuclear accident since Chernobyl, which resulted in the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. Until now, accidents about nuclear power plants have always been in the headlines, just as the safety of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant has been closely watched during the war between Russia and Ukraine. Nuclear power plant safety is about the safety of people and the environment, so we want to take a look at the impacts of nuclear power station leaks, how these effects change over time, and what are the implications of past nuclear leaks for the future through the two major nuclear safety incidents that have occurred.

Those reports provide information about the effects of exposures from the Chernobyl Accident starting from 1986. The data are organized in form of tables at the end of each report, including the estimates of the release of radionuclides, their concentrations in the worldwide ground-level air, food, and human body, and some other interesting aspects such as population change. Here is the link of the UNSCEAR official website and all the reports published: https://www.unscear.org/unscear/en/chernobyl.html 2.2 The Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident in 2011 Data used for Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident were obtained from UNSCEAR 2020/2021 Report and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). The datasets from UNSCEAR report contains the evaluation of doses for public due to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. These data are provided for each age group (adults, 10-year-old children and one-year-old infants) for each geographical area group (all non-evacuated districts within Fukushima Prefecture, districts close to Fukushima prefectures (Chiba, Gunma, Ibaraki, Iwate, Miyagi and Tochigi, labeled as Neighbouring), and for all remaining prefectures in Japan (labeled as Remainder)). And four principal pathways by which members of the public can be exposed for the radioactive material released to the atmosphere are considered and summed up. The MAFF released the latest results of the detection of radioactive substances (mainly radioactive cesium) in agricultural, livestock and aquatic products after the accident. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The Chernobyl Accident in 1986 We used the online PDF to Excel converter to transform the tables published by UNSCEAR to .xlxs files. By using readxl::read_excel and setting skip to some value, we were able to drop messy headlines and get nice and neat data frames. The reports claim that external irradiation from radioactive materials dumped on the ground and consumption of contaminated food are the two key paths to consider in the dose assessment (the term dose assessment means estimating absorbed doses received by individuals as a result of exposure to ionizing radiation). For radionuclides, we only consider Iodine-131, Caesium-134, and Caesium-137 since they are the most significant contributions to total exposure and have been extensively considered by many countries. For contaminated food, only the most fundamental foods have been considered: milk, grains, leafy greens, other vegetables and fruits, and meat. Most people’s food intake can be classified into one of these five groups. Other foods, such as mushrooms and lake fish, have been found to absorb radionuclides and may be essential to some consumers, but they have little impact on collective dosage estimates. Therefore, we only focus on these variables in this project. During the process of data cleaning, the most frequently used package is tidyverse, which helps manipulate the data frames. The functions select, pivot_longer, and fill were applied to almost every data frame in order to select the variables we want and transform the data into a form for ggplot. The Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident in 2011 For data files related to the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, the original data were downloaded as .xls files from the official website in the data section. The Excels turned out to be messy after reading in R using readxl::read_excel, so we did some work to process and clean them. For the fish-related files, 10 files covering from 2012 to 2021 were combined with rbind() and processed with multiple functions, and the number of samples below/exceeding the standard limit were counted using summarize() by year, type of fish species and prefecture. The agricultural products and milk-related files were pretty tidy so that pipes %&gt;% were used to simply extract and calculate the features. Data cleaning for the absorbed dose to the thyroid-related files were similar to the fish-related files. Messy headlines were first removed and only useful data were kept. Then, 9 Tables were combined and processed differently with multiple functions based on the age group and area. For details of coding, please see here. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values A total of 23 data files were used in this project. In this case, instead of checking each file for missing patterns here, we choose one file as an example. The first plot above displays the position of the missing values of each row in the dataset, where the x-axis is the column and the y-axis is the row. We see that 12 rows have 2 missing values, 7 rows have one missing balue, and only the 17th row does not have missing values. The two leftmost columns have the most missing values (1982-1985 and Age at exposure (years)), the rest columns do not have missing values. There are some patterns for particular rows and columns, which are shown in the second plot. From the second plot we can see that there are total 4 different patterns by rows, with one pattern has no missing values.About half of the rows are in the first missing patterns. In fact, those NAs in column Age at exposure (years) are due to the different format when we read the Excel in R and convert it to a dataframe, so it should not be considered when analyzing missing patterns. And thus, only the NAs in 1982-1985 are actual missing values, and they have no patterns. As for the other data files, most of them do no have any NAs, and those with NAs are mostly due to formatting issues or just no radioactive materials detected (i.e., equal to 0). "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The Chernobyl Accident in 1986 5.2 The Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident in 2011", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 The Chernobyl Accident in 1986 5.1.1 Radionuclide Releases to, Dispersion and Deposition in Air This plot is about the concentration of Iodine-131 (I-131), Caesium-134 (Cs-134), and Caesium-137 (Cs-137) in ground level air for these countries listed in the y-axis. As we can see from the plot, the concentration of I-131 is higher for all the countries than Cs-134 and Cs-137, whereas the concentration of Cs-134 is almost the lowest for all the countries. In addition, these countries were grouped by “North Europe”, “Central Europe”, “West Europe”, “South Europe”, “West Asia”, “East Asia”, and “North America” and the order is determined by the median value of the concentration of these three radionuclides. It is clear that Central Europe suffers the most and North America suffers the least. This intuitively makes sense if we take their distances to Chernobyl into account. Note these three x-axis have different scales. We designed the plot in this way since the concentration of I-131 is tremendously higher than the other two. If they used same scale, the points related to Cs-134 and Cs-137 would be very close to 0 and they would coincident. 5.1.2 Deposition This plot is about the deposition of Iodine-131 (I-131), Caesium-134 (Cs-134), and Caesium-137 (Cs-137) for the same countries in the previous plot. The deposition of radioactive materials is mainly related to rainfall. Again, the deposition of I-131 is higher for all the countries than Cs-134 and Cs-137, whereas the concentration of Cs-134 is almost the lowest for all the countries. In addition, these countries were grouped in the same way as the previous plot and the order is determined by the median as well. However, the order changes for other groups except Central Europe, East Asia, and North America. This might be due to the irregularity of weather. As mentioned before, the deposition pattern is related to rainfall. However, the distances to Chernobyl can still explain the unchanged order of Central Europe, East Asia, and North America. Note these three x-axis have different scales. We designed the plot in this way since the deposition of I-131 is tremendously higher than the other two. If they used same scale, the points related to Cs-134 and Cs-137 would be very close to 0 and they would coincident. 5.1.3 Radionuclide Releases to, Dispersion and Deposition of different radioactive elements I-131 This plot shows the normalized concentration of Iodine-131 (I-131) in leafy vegetables and milk products during the first year for different countries after the Chernobyl accident. The term normalized concentration represents integrated concentrations in foods normalized to the deposition densities, which better shows local conditions. Again, these points represent the same countries used in the previous plots and the x-axis means the latitude measured in degrees north. For each kind of food, there seem to be a negative linear latitudinal dependence for the normalized concentration of I-131, which makes sense since distances to the Chernobyl do affect the concentration of radioactive materials. In addition, the line seems to be steeper for leafy vegetables than milk. The normalized concentration of I-131 of these two foods seem to be at similar level, but leafy vegetables seems to have several outliers, which shows a comparatively higher concentration of I-131 per deposition density. This suggests us to choose milk instead of leafy vegetables for safety. Cs137 This plot shows the normalized concentration of Caesium-137 (Cs-137) in grain, leafy vegetables, meat, milk products and vegetables or fruits during the first year for previous countries after the Chernobyl accident. For each kind of food, there seem to be a latitudinal dependence for the normalized concentration of Cs-137, which makes sense since distances to the Chernobyl do affect the concentration of radioactive materials. The linear trend is not very obvious for meat. For other foods, the slope of the lines seems to be similar. Since this is about normalized concentration, we cannot really compare the level of concentration of each food, but meat seems to have many outliers, which shows a comparatively higher concentration of Cs-137. In addition, vegetables or fruits have several outliers as well. The normalized concentration of Cs-137 of grain, leafy vegetables, and milk products seem to be at a similar level. Meat seems to have many outliers and a higher level of concentration of Cs-137. In addition, vegetables or fruits have several outliers as well, but the majority points are located in very bottom. This suggests us not to choose meat for safety. 5.1.4 Assessment of Doses to the Public The term ‘dose equivalent’ means measuring the biological damage to living tissue as a result of radiation exposure. This time, these countries were grouped into “Europe”, “Asia” and “N.A.” (North America). This plot is about the average of Thyroid dose equivalent in the first year after the Chernobyl accident. Again, the order is determined by the median. As we can see, the infants suffered more than adults in general. More specifically, the thyroid of infants in Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia were strongly damaged by exposure. The situations for the countries in the bottom shows that distances to the Chernobyl help reduce the exposures of radioactive materials. This plot demonstrates a long-term trend for incidence rates of thyroid cancer for people living in Belarus, Russian Federation (Bryansk, Kaluga, Orel and Tula oblasts) and Ukraine. Note that the rates were calculated as number of cases per 100,000 person-years. As we can see, the rates are increasing for both female and male in all age groups “0-4”, “5-9”, “10-14”, “15-18” from 1982 to 2015. Note that this plot does not indicate there is a causation relationship between the Chernobyl accident and the increasing rates, it just shows a fact that the incidence rates of thyroid cancer did increasing for people in all age groups (under 18 years). Since we are using same scales for x and y, respectively, it is easy to see that the incidence rates of thyroid cancer for female are higher than those of male in general and incidence rates of thyroid cancer for people in Belarus are higher than those in two other regions. 5.2 The Fukushima-Daiichi Nuclear Power Station Accident in 2011 5.2.1 Radionuclide Releases to, Dispersion and Deposition in Food 5.2.1.1 Seafood Japan is an island country surrounded by sea, so seafood has become a major part of food. Its seafood consumption leads the world and is deeply loved by people all over the world. So did the nuclear accident contaminate those seafood? How long will these radioactive elements remain? Let’s take a look at fish as an example. Marine Fish Species The results of the analysis of radioactive cesium (134Cs and 137Cs) in marine fish species showed that immediately after the nuclear power station accident in 2011, about 16% of samples collected in Fukushima prefecture exceeded the current standard limit (100 Bq/kg). Since then, the percentages of samples exceeding the standard limit tends to decrease over time, dropping to 0 starting in 2015. In Fukushima Prefecture, there have been no such cases for 6 consecutive years until 1 sample exceeding the standard limit was detected in 2021. In prefectures other than Fukushima, after 4 years without such cases, one sample was detected exceeding the standard limit in 2019, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Freshwater Fish Species The results of the analysis of radioactive cesium in freshwater fish species showed that many freshwater fish in Fukushima and other prefectures exceeded the current standard limit (100 Bq/kg) shortly after the nuclear power plant accident in 2011. Since then, the percentages of samples exceeding the standard limit has decreased year by year, with the exception of Fukushima prefecture in 2017 and 2021 and prefectures other than Fukushima in 2019. Comparing marine and freshwater fish species, we found that freshwater fish were more likely to be detected in excess of radiocaesium. Apparently, the corresponding trend for prefectures other than Fukushima Prefecture showed its percentages of samples with radiocaesium concentrations exceeding 100 Bq/kg were lower than in Fukushima Prefecture, and thus, fish in Fukushima prefecture were more contaminated with radioactive cesium in the four years following the accident than in other prefectures. And the radiocaesium concentration decreases over time for fish species. 5.2.1.2 Agricultural Products Rice, vegetables and fruits are the necessities of everyone’s daily life, providing some essential nutrients for our body and maintaining our health. So how do they perform in terms of radiocaesium concentrations? In order to see the change over time, we made a time series plot as shown below. From the plot we can see that the radioactive cesium content of these essential agricultural products is basically within the safe range. About 0.06% of fruit samples exceeded the current standard limit in 2017, while other samples contained less than 100 Bq/kg of radioactive cesium. Therefore, the accident has little impact on these agricultural products as a whole. 5.2.1.3 Raw Milk Milk is essential for people especially for infants, it not only contains high-quality protein, but also trace elements, especially calcium, that our body needs for growth. The standard limit of radioactive cesium content of milk is half of that of general food, which is 50 Bq/kg. Years here, such as 2010, are from April 2020 to March 2021, and so on. We see that about 4.62% of raw milk samples in 2010 exceeded the current standard limit, all those samples that exceeded were collected in March 2021 (but belongs to Year 2020 as defined), immediately after the accident, while all other samples contained less than 50 Bq/kg of radioactive cesium in the following years. Therefore, there is little impact on raw milk after the first year of the accident. 5.2.2 Assessment of Doses to the Public The two most important radionuclides are iodine and cesium, with varying dose levels. Iodine-131 is first absorbed by the thyroid after ingestion or inhalation, but it dissipates quickly because of its short half-life (8 days). The two isotopes of cesium (cesium-134 and cesium-137) have relatively long half-lives (2 and 30 years, respectively), and the exposure to the human body is fairly uniform. The Committee’s estimates of municipality- and prefecture-average doses are intended to be characteristic of the average doses to the thyroid absorbed by people living in each municipality or prefecture for the first year after the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power station accident. Due to the fact that the amount of data is too large to run in R, a dot plot is performed instead of a histogram or ridgeline plot. The plot clearly showed the trend that younger people tend to absorb higher doses to the thyroid than older people. It’s also obvious that the closer to Fukushima prefecture, where the accident occurred, the higher dose absorbed to the thyroid. Now let’s take a closer look at Fukushima prefecture. The ridgeline plot allows us to easily compare distributions of the absorbed doses for people in Fukushima Prefecture (excluding evacuated areas) in the first year. We see that the distributions for all age groups are multimodal that have many peaks, and the shape of the curves for the three age groups looks very similar. The younger the age, the higher the absorbed dose, and the absorbed dose for one-year-old infants is about 4-5 times that of the adults. Meanwhile, the absorption range of the elderly is narrower.
